                        <p>
                            Our future is technology and I, for one, wish to be 
                            dead center in it. My name is Shreya Chandra and I 
                            am a freshman at Dublin High School who aspires to 
                            be a Software Engineer. This is my career of choice 
                            because I want to improve the technology used in our
                            daily lives and be able to have my own creative 
                            freedom to develop products that will improve our 
                            society as a whole. My intended path to reach this 
                            career goal is to immerse myself as much as possible
                            within engineering throughout these next four high 
                            school years. My first steps to doing so are taking 
                            Computer Science Principles, an introductory course 
                            that teaches programming and the basics behind the 
                            workings of the internet. I have joined Build Club,
                            in which we peer tutor, build machines to assist in
                            the Special Olympics, and spread the word of 
                            engineering around. Through this club, I am able to 
                            attend 3D printing workshop sessions along with 
                            meeting guest speakers every few weeks to learn 
                            about their story and how they have gotten to the 
                            STEM based job they are at now. As of Spring 2019, I
                            have joined the Engineering Academy to build my
                            foundational knowledge of engineering and gather 
                            real world experience in this field of study.

                        <p>
                            Although I have not yet gained much experience 
                            within the world of Computer Science, I have had 
                            experience participating in other activities that 
                            have tested my abilities. I am a figure skater, so I
                            strive to wake up and practice before my school day 
                            begins, five mornings a week. I have been doing this
                            sport for 8 years, along with 4 years of experience
                            being on a synchronized skating team. I was captain
                            for 2 of those 4 years, having learned the 
                            resilience and patience needed to keep everyone on 
                            my team accountable. I am no longer a member of the 
                            team, for I wish to pursue this passion as an 
                            individual competitor. Figure skating as a whole has
                            taught me to keep myself accountable as I alone am 
                            responsible for how well I perform and to be 
                            disciplined, as I have had to sacrifice many 
                            experiences other peers my age get to enjoy in lieu 
                            of practices or competitions.

                            Over the summer of 2018, I worked as a camp 
                            counselor at Dublin Iceland to provide children with
                            fairly little to no background experience skating 
                            the chance to learn the basics of this sport. I
                            needed to keep track of my own group of campers, 
                            supervising them during practice time, 
                            choreographing a routine for them to perform at the 
                            end of the week, and ensuring positive camper 
                            experience through group bonding activities. This 
                            experience has taught me to remain patient and calm
                            when working with others, for things would not 
                            always work out the way I wanted them to. I used the
                            first few days on the job to mirror other counselors
                            and understand how the camp dynamic worked, which I 
                            quickly picked up on. I was unafraid to ask my head 
                            supervisor questions and worked cooperatively with 
                            my fellow counselors, unafraid to handle some of the
                            more dreaded tasks. I have never been one to back 
                            down from challenging concepts/tasks and I will 
                            always be a dedicated team member. Thank you for 
                            taking the time to read through my About Me and 
                            considering me to be part of your workforce. I 
                            invite you to explore the rest of my website and I 
                            promise I will not disappoint!
