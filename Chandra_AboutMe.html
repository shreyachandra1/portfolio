                                Our future lies in space and I, for one, wish to be dead center in it. My name is Shreya Chandra and I am a junior at Dublin High School who aspires to
                                work in the field of Aerospace Engineering. This is my career of choice because I want to play a role in improving the technology used in our daily lives,
                                as well as have the creative freedom to develop efficient and engaging products. My intended path to reaching this goal is to immerse myself fully in 
                                engineering throughout my high school years. I have already begun to do so by taking AP Computer Science Principles in my freshman year, an introductory 
                                college-level course that taught programming and the basics of the internet, in which I received a 5 on the AP Exam. As of Spring 2019, I have enrolled in
                                Project Lead the Way's Engineering Academy to build my foundational knowledge of engineering and gather real world experience in this field of study. In my
                                sophomore year, I completed Honors Principles of Engineering to survey various fields of engineering through hands-on activities and projects, all of which
                                assist in building teamwork skills. Currently, I am taking AP Computer Science Applications in order to further develop my programming skills and gain 
                                experience developing and testing numerous projects. I have been a member of Build Club since Fall 2018, through which I peer tutor students in Engineering
                                and participate in the Outreach program, allowing me to attend 3D printing workshop sessions and meet guest speakers every few weeks to 
                                learn about their story and how they have climbed their way through the fields of STEM.

                                Although I still have much to learn from both Engineering and Computer Science, I have had experience participating in other activities that have tested my
                                abilities. I am a figure skater, meaning I wake up and practice before my school day begins, five mornings a week. I have been an avid competitor in this 
                                sport for 9 years. Throughout my years as an athlete, I have learned how to hold myself accountable as I alone am responsible for how well I perform, 
                                thus I have had to balance both a rigorous course schedule along with the demands of training many hours both on and off the ice. Furthermore, this sport 
                                has instillled discipline within me, as I have had to sacrifice many experiences other peers my age get to enjoy in lieu of practices or competitions, along
                                with eating nutritious meals on a daily basis and ensuring I remain focused during practices and conditioning.
