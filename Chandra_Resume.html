                            I partipated in a Machine Learning internship through STEM-Away throughout the summer of 2020. This internship allowed me to gain experience collaborating with 
                            a team of high school and college students from all around the world, all of whom have varying background experiences and skill sets. Together, we created a 
                            oversampling, tokenization, one hot encoding, and recurring neural networks. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            Furthermore, during the summer of 2018, I worked as a camp counselor at Dublin Iceland to provide children with fairly little to no background experience 
                            skating the opportunity to learn the basics of this sport. I needed to keep track of my own group of campers, supervising them during practice time, 
                            choreographing a routine for them to perform at the end of the week, and ensuring positive camper experience through group bonding activities. This experience
                            has taught me to remain patient and calm when working with others, for things would not always work out the way I wanted them to. I used the first few days on
                            the job to mirror other counselors and understand how the camp dynamic worked, which I quickly picked up on. I was unafraid to ask my head supervisor questions,
                            worked cooperatively with my fellow counselors, and was undaunted when handling some of the more dreaded tasks. I have never been one to back down from 
                            challenging concepts/tasks and will always be a diligent team member. Thank you for taking the time to read through my About Me and considering me to be part 
                            of your workforce. I invite you to explore the rest of my website and I promise I will not disappoint!

                            During my time in the Engineering Academy program, I have met a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers, through whom I've gained valuable insight
                            about the STEM workfield. One field trip I went on during my sophomore year of high school was to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in which I visited the National Ignition Facility
                            (NIF). At NIF, I was first introduced to the primary fuel sources the facility is experimenting with, including deuterium and tritium (hydrogen isotopes) fuel, by one NIF scientist. Accompanied
                            by another NIF computer scientist, I toured the facility and was able to view its lasers and nuclear reactors up close. Throughout this tour, I learned about how a weak laser pulse is split
                            multiple times during a reaction to pass through numerous laser amplifier beamlines, and then travels through an optics assembly before being focused onto the laser beam's target, a journey 
                            that takes about only 5 microseconds. This experience was both useful and memorable to me because I was able to view how computer science could be used in a research setting for scientific 
                            topics beyond simply software, as well as being able to connect what I had recently learned about nuclear science in my Honors Chemistry class to this real life laboratory. Also, as I had been
                            paired with a tour guide who had majored in computer science, she was able to answer all of my questions about the computer/software used by researchers at NIF, which added greatly to my 
                            overall field trip experience.

                            One influential guest speaker was Jason Yosinski, who works at UBER AI Labs and provided my Honors Principles of Engineering class with an in-depth explanation to artifical intelligence in
                            contrast to machine learning, along with showing us several projects he had worked on. From his presentation, I learned that machine learning is a more specific version of AI, as it will 
                            continuously improve/gain knowledge, while AI itself is a broad description of items/programs with artificial intelligence that may or may not improve. I also learned about language moduling 
                            with Google and OpenAI, which is a software companies are testing to improve the interaction of humans with their virtual assistants (such as Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa), and about 
                            neural networks, which are made up of layers, with each layer having a vector as both an input and output. Mr. Yosinksi further detailed how, to make a whole neural network, multiple layers 
                            are stacked on top of one another. His career was inspiring to me because I was able to see the potential of what AI could develop into in the future, and has made me want to undertake some
                            AI-based projects.

                            In the fall of 2020, I attended a virtual field trip held by Lockheed Martin, in which I was provided with the opportunity to receive a tour of their numerous facilities, as well as hear 
                            the perspectives of many of their workers, which opened my eyes to a side of the space industry I had not been previously aware of. This field trip was the deciding factor for me in deciding
                            to major specifically in aerospace engineering, as I was able to see the potential of what could be developed in the years to come. My favorite parts of this field trip included a presentation
                            by a former astronaut, as well as the explanations of their various facilities and individual uses.
                        </p>

                            An additional virtual field trip I attended was that of the Livermore Airport. In this field trip, I received a tour of the entire airport, including the main building and the runways themselves.
                            I was able to see the various planes that flew in and out of the hangar, as well as learned precisely what the purpose of this particular airport was (as it is not used for most regular flights). 
                            I learned about the drone technology several of the people at the airport were working to develop, as well as received a presentation by a retired Air Force officer who described the various planes
                            he flew on during his time in the army and his current personal project of building his own personal plane. I particularly enjoyed learning the specifics behind what goes into obtaining a private 
                            pilot's license and the developmental process that goes into building a plane yourself.
