                                Although I can’t remember when I first became fascinated by space, the universe captivates me like nothing else. Hi, I am Shreya Chandra, a senior at 
                                Dublin High School and I plan to major in aerospace engineering, as this major provides me with a direct route to understanding the concepts essential
                                to successfully design exoplanetary objects, including orbital mechanics, spacecraft design, and propulsion. Throughout my career, the projects I would
                                like to undertake are primarily bioastronautics, space architecture, and propulsion based. I hope to play a role in improving the space suits astronauts
                                use in order to make them far more functional, particularly when it comes to astronauts’ gloves, helmets, and boots. Additionally, I would like to work
                                on designing space habits for both the Moon and Mars in order to make these two celestial objects habitable for humans for extended periods of time. I 
                                also aim to play a role in improving the fuel sources utilized to power rockets to further how far we travel beyond Earth. To sharpen my skills to take
                                on these types of projects, my journey will likely include undertaking two masters degrees, the first potentially being Aerospace Engineering with a 
                                Bioastronautics specialization at CU Boulder, and the second being Space Architecture at the University of Houston.
                            </p>

                                I have begun to work towards this goal by being a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy (DEDA) throughout my four years at Dublin High
                                School. At the end of my freshman year, 60 students were selected to join the new cohort, and we were offered the ability to take numerous engineering
                                classes throughout high school. I chose to take AP Computer Science Principles, Honors Principles of Engineering, AP Computer Science Applications, and 
                                Intro to Engineering Design. In these classes, I was introduced to various engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, and aerospace 
                                engineering. Additionally, at the end of each school year, students participated in an Entrepreneurship Competition to create an innovation for an existing
                                item or a brand new product. My team, having developed and 3D modeled a pollution-removing drone, was named a finalist for the 2021 DEDA Entrepreneurship 
                                Competition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During junior and senior year, I served as the academy’s student representative, working with a board of teachers and industry representatives to review 
                                academy progression, potential changes to implement, and identify what components are leading to student success. The academy has also allowed me to 
                                become president of its corresponding club, Engineering Club, in which we manage all DEDA-related funds and are in the process of setting up peer tutoring
                                for our engineering classes. I founded and am currently president of Aerospace Club, within which we have participated in Blue Origin’s Design/Build/Launch
                                competition to develop a proposal for a potential space experiment. We are now participating in both NASA’s Lunabotics Junior competition and General Aviation
                                Manufacturers Association (GAMA) Aviation Design Challenge, in which we will complete curriculum about the science of flight and airplane design and compete to
                                modify the design of an airplane. I am president of Build Club as well, which further sharpens my engineering capabilities through working on our MIT 
                                Inventeam-funded sPort project, a robotic arm allowing special needs students to participate in the Special Olympics. Outside of school, I am a high school 
                                member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
