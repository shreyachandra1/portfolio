                            For our Color My Canvas Project, developed using MIT
                            App Inventor, my partner and I selected and redesigned
                            one of the provided apps known as "Colored Dots," a 
                            limited drawing app that would only allow the user to 
                            paint in dots, and was confusing to utilize due to its
                            color options that could not be easily be switched back
                            and forth. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZLq85OxpyAqusBzgwViZMozUMGDPdo4FgJGu3L_3ck/edit">criteria</a> 
                            to partner program an app requiring a detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDy9y-1CruAQTW22tYjq0EVIw6gwwfzpsSiryvEGzAY/edit">log</a> 
                            as to how our work was evenly distributed. To meet our 
                            necessary <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KnpPf1a0VIaqRaPpG82soCLpUK5OAFW7t8vD9iFWehc/edit">requirements</a>,
                            my partner and I brainstormed how to make the user 
                            experience more fulfilling and be a versatile tool, 
                            causing us to rebuild the framework of the app. The 
                            newly created app now has a bar with prestored colors
                            and a canvas that draws lines in all directions. The
                            size of the paintbrush was made to be adjustable and 
                            we included two different eraser settings, one which
                            erased the entire canvas and another where only small
                            sections of the canvas would be erased by dragging a 
                            finger. A separate button was added to provide 
                            instuctions to the user for an easy overall app 
                            experience. The main challenges encountered while 
                            developing this app were making the eraser remove only
                            specific sections of the drawing and creating a 
                            scrollable bar with preset colors for the user. I 
                            personally resolved both of these challenges head-on
                            as team leader and primary coder, while my partner 
                            focused more on the brush size and main screen, as 
                            well as the documentation. This project scored 
                            remarkably high because it met the criteria in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gMmFmeIxA1pd9tI7KSTZrKZLo0uDVdpbo3letCn2TXk/edit">rubric</a>. 
                            Throughout this project, I learned how to use advanced
                            features on MIT App Inventor and how to troubleshoot
                            effectively with a partner in order to make one aspect
                            or button of the app carry out various functions.

                            developed using Python, my partner and I selected
                            to meet the requirements of the product client, who
                            wanted to be able to apply their brand image as a frame,
                            overlay, or silhoutte to a large number of image, as
                            well seeing abstract art and geometric shapes 
                            offered throughout. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dh3VQdjs9nYQ9L1TJH1MKaLyEqaGQ2cO1uKhTWty8mE/edit">criteria</a> 
                            to partner program a product requiring a detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gSdtuXCazAwYHY7kK3sOUCdkvuszO9sIC3mhbYg13Q/edit">log</a> 
                            as to how our work was evenly distributed. Our final
                            product allows the client to include a pre-designed
                            logo, drop shadow effect, and multiple borders. The
                            client may alter the logo's color, opacity, size, 
                            and location. The background color can be changed, 
                            or an image can be used as the background of 
                            another for the drop shadow effect. The various 
                            borders offered can also change in both color and 
                            thickness. We encountered a multitude of problems 
                            during the development phase of our project, primarily
                            in how we would allow the user to modify each mask to 
                            their desire, which my partner and I worked together
                            to resolve through continuous trials and modification.
                            My main tasks in the assignment were creating the logo,
                            horizontal stripes border, triangle corners border,
                            triangle sides border, and triangles and rectangles 
                            border, and I assisted my partner when needed in 
                            allowing the user to apply multiple masks at once.
                            This project received full credit because it met the
                            necessary criteria in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iW61y3ZrsSVRWcH1_VTykV3_JLrBGTiF1LAsQqh870w/edit">rubric</a>
                            and offered more complexity than desired. Throughout
                            this project, I learned how to apply a mulitude of 
                            features to images using Python, how to create higher
                            level code that includes efficient algorithms and 
                            abstractions, and how to compromise and work effectively
                            with a partner when issues arose in our code.

                            prototype powered by a FisherTech motor that would
                            lift a 1.152N weight 30cm off of the ground. We also
                            had to produce a working NetLogo simulation of our 
                            prototype. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dh3VQdjs9nYQ9L1TJH1MKaLyEqaGQ2cO1uKhTWty8mE/edit">criteria</a>

                            motor, which powers a Fisher Tech gear. On the same axle
                            as the Fisher Tech gear is a VEX gear, powering a simple
                            gear train by connecting to a larger VEX gear, which shares
                            the same axle as the "spool" of thread used to lift the
                            weight. The main problem my team encountered was determining
                            how to successfully power the motor to turn our two gear 
                            trains, which we resolved through trial and error, spending
                            additional time after school for many days in order to 
                            ensure our system worked properly. I was project manager,
                            meaning I ensured my team was systematically accomplishing
                            the necessary requirements. My main tasks in the assignment 
                            were creating the NetLogo simulation, as well as working 
                            hands-on with my team to construct our prototype. This 
                            project scored well because it met the necessary criteria in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iW61y3ZrsSVRWcH1_VTykV3_JLrBGTiF1LAsQqh870w/edit">rubric</a>.
                            Throughout this project, I learned how to create user
                            modifiable GUIs using the NetLogo programming language,
                            how to hold a team accountable and keep them motivated, 
                            and gained familiarity with both Fisher Tech and VEX parts.
