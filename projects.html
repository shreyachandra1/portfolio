                     For the MIT App Inventor Project, my partner and I chose to
                     redesign this app called 'Colored Dots,' which only painted
                     in dots and made us create and store different color 
                     variations, which was extremely difficult to use. We were 
                     provided with <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/
                     document/d/1EZLq85OxpyAqusBzgwViZMozUMGDPdo4FgJGu3L_3ck/
                     edit">criteria</a> to partner program an app with a 
                     detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/
                     document/d/1LDy9y-1CruAQTW22tYjq0EVIw6gwwfzpsSiryvEGzAY/
                     edit">log</a> as to how we evenly distributed our work. We 
                     took this project apart and rebuilt it so that it fit our
                     necessary <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/
                     document/d/1gMmFmeIxA1pd9tI7KSTZrKZLo0uDVdpbo3letCn2TXk/
                     edit">requirements</a>. The newly created app now has a bar
                     with prestored colors and a canvas that draws lines in any 
                     and all directions. The size of the paintbrush was made to 
                     be adjustable and we had two different eraser settings, one
                     where it erased the entire canvas and another where where 
                     only a small section of the canvas where the finger is 
                     dragged would be erased. A separate button also provided
                     instuctions to the user for an overall easy app experience.
                     This project scored remarkably high because it followed the 
                     <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KnpP

                     Throughout this project, I learned how to use advanced 
                     features on MIT App Inventor and how to troubleshoot in 
                     order to make one aspect of the project carry out various 
                     functions.
