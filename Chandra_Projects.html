                            Given a template, create an app with a partner that 
                            incorporates your own design elements using MIT App
                            Inventor.

                             For the MIT App Inventor Project, my partner and I 
                             chose to redesign an app called 'Colored Dots,' 
                             which originally painted in dots and made the user 
                             create and store different color variations, making
                             it extremely difficult to use. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZLq85OxpyAqusBzgwViZMozUMGDPdo4FgJGu3L_3ck/edit">criteria</a> 
                             to partner program an app requiring a detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDy9y-1CruAQTW22tYjq0EVIw6gwwfzpsSiryvEGzAY/edit">log</a> 
                             as to how our work was evenly distributed. To fit 
                             our necessary <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gMmFmeIxA1pd9tI7KSTZrKZLo0uDVdpbo3letCn2TXk/edit">requirements</a>,
                             my partner and I brainstormed how to make the user 
                             experience more fulfilling and be a versatile tool, 
                             causingus to rebuild the framework of the app. The 
                             newly created app now has a bar with prestored 
                             colors and a canvas that draws lines in all 
                             directions. The size of the paintbrush was made to 
                             be adjustable and we included two different eraser 
                             settings, one which erased the entire canvas and 
                             another where only small sections of the canvas 
                             would be erased by dragging a finger. A separate
                             button was added to provide instuctions to the user
                             for an easy overall app experience. This project 
                             scored remarkably high because it met the criteria 
                             in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KnpPf1a0VIaqRaPpG82soCLpUK5OAFW7t8vD9iFWehc/edit">rubric</a>. 
                             Throughout this project, I learned how to use 
                             advanced features on MIT App Inventor and how to 
                             troubleshoot effectively with a partner in order to
                             make one aspect or button of the app carry out 
                             various functions.
