                    Our future is technology and I, for one, wish to be dead 
                    center in it. My name is Shreya Chandra and I am a freshman
                    at Dublin High School who aspires to become a Software 
                    Engineer. This is my career of choice because I want to 
                    improve the technology used in our daily lives and be able 
                    to have my own creative freedom to develop products that 
                    will improve the daily lives of everyone. My intended path 
                    to reach this career goal is to immerse myself as much as 
                    possible within engineering throughout these next four 
                    years. My first steps to doing so are taking Computer 
                    Science Principles, an introductory course that teaches me 
                    programming and the basics behind the workings of the 
                    internet. I have joined Build Club, in which we spread the 
                    word of engineering around as much as possible, attending 3D
                    printing workshop sessions along with meeting guest speakers
                    every few weeks to learn about their story and how they have
                    gotten to the STEM based job they are at now. In the spring 
                    of 2019, I plan to apply for the Engineering 
                    Academy to truly test and enrich my skills.

                    Although I have not yet gained much experience within the 
                    world of Computer Science, I have had experience 
                    participating in other activities that have tested my 
                    abilities and I continue to push myself. I am a figure 
                    skater, so I strive to wake up and practice before my school
                    day begins, five mornings a week. I have been doing this 
                    sport for 7.5 years now, along with four years of experience
                    being on a synchronized skating team. I was captain for 2.5 
                    of those 4 years, having learned the resilience and patience 
                    needed to keep everyone on my team accountable. I am no 
                    longer a member of the team, for I wish to pursue this 
                    passion as an individual competitor. Figure skating as a 
                    whole has taught me to keep myself accountable as I alone am
                    responsible for how well I perform and to be disciplined,
                    as I have had to sacrifice many experiences other peers my 
                    age get to enjoy in lieu of practice or competition.

                    Over the summer of 2018, I worked as a camp counselor at 
                    Dublin Iceland to provide children with fairly little to no 
                    background experience skating the chance to learn how to 
                    learn the basics of this sport. I needed to keep track of my 
                    own group of children, supervising them during practice time,
                    choreographing a routine for them to perform at the end of
                    the week, and taking disciplinary action when necessary to 
                    make sure everything ran as smoothly as it should have. This
                    experience has certainly taught me to remain patient and 
                    calm when working with others, for things would not always
                    work out the way I wanted them to. I used the first few days 
                    on the job to mirror others and understand how the camp
                    dynamic work, which I quickly picked up on. I wasn't afraid
                    to ask questions to my head supervisor and worked 
                    cooperatively with my fellow counselors, unafraid to handle
                    some of the more dreaded tasks. I have never been one to 
                    back down from challenging concepts/tasks and I will always 
                    be a dedicated team member. Thank you for taking the time to
                    read through my portfolio and consider me to be part of your 
                    workforce. I promise I will not disappoint!
