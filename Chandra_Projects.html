                     For the MIT App Inventor Project, my partner and I chose to
                     redesign an app called 'Colored Dots,' which originally
                     painted in dots and made the user create and store 
                     different color variations, making it extremely difficult
                     to use. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZLq85OxpyAqusBzgwViZMozUMGDPdo4FgJGu3L_3ck/edit">criteria</a> 
                     to partner program an app requiring a detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDy9y-1CruAQTW22tYjq0EVIw6gwwfzpsSiryvEGzAY/edit">log</a> 
                     as to how our work was evenly distributed. To fit our 
                     necessary <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gMmFmeIxA1pd9tI7KSTZrKZLo0uDVdpbo3letCn2TXk/edit">requirements</a>,
                     my partner and I brainstormed how to make the user 
                     experience more fulfilling and be a versatile tool, causing
                     us to rebuild the framework of the app. The newly created 
                     app now has a bar with prestored colors and a canvas that 
                     draws lines in all directions. The size of the paintbrush 
                     was made to be adjustable and we included two different 
                     eraser settings, one which erased the entire canvas and 
                     another where only small sections of the canvas would be 
                     erased by dragging a finger. A separate button was added to
                     provide instuctions to the user for an easy overall app 
                     experience. This project scored remarkably high because it 
                     met the criteria in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KnpPf1a0VIaqRaPpG82soCLpUK5OAFW7t8vD9iFWehc/edit">rubric</a>. 
                     Throughout this project, I learned how to use advanced 
                     features on MIT App Inventor and how to troubleshoot 
                     effectively with a partner in order to make one aspect or 
                     button of the app carry out various functions.
