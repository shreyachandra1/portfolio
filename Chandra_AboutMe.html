                            <p>
                                Our future is technology and I, for one, wish to be 
                                dead center in it. My name is Shreya Chandra and I 
                                am a sophomore at Dublin High School who aspires to 
                                work in the field of Computer Science and 
                                Engineering. This is my career of choice because I 
                                want to play a role in improving the technology
                                used in our daily lives, as well as have the 
                                creative freedom to develop efficient and engaging
                                products. My intended path to reaching this goal is
                                to immerse myself fully in engineering throughout my
                                high school years. I have already begun to do so by
                                taking AP Computer Science Principles in my freshman 
                                year, an introductory college-level course that 
                                taught programming and the basics of the internet,
                                in which I received a 5 on the AP Exam. As of Spring 
                                2019, I have enrolled in Project Lead the Way's
                                Engineering Academy to build my foundational knowledge
                                of engineering and gather real world experience in 
                                this field of study. I am currently taking Honors
                                Principles of Engineering to learn the foundations
                                and survey various fields of engineering through
                                hands-on activities and projects, all of which assist
                                in building teamwork skills. I have been a member of 
                                Build Club since Fall 2018, through which I peer 
                                tutor students in Computer Science and participate 
                                in the Outreach program, in which I am able to 
                                attend 3D printing workshop sessions and meet guest
                                speakers every few weeks to learn about their story 
                                and how they have climbed their way through the fields
                                of STEM. Through my school's Technovation Club/Program,
                                which encourages girls to participate in a computer 
                                science and entrepreneurship competition, this year I 
                                have also taken up a passion project of developing and 
                                marketing a climate change app meant to inform players 
                                of worldwide environmental problems and how they can 
                                take steps to alleviating these issues, all while 
                                enjoying a fun game.

                                Although I still have much to learn from both 
                                Engineering and Computer Science, I have had 
                                experience participating in other activities that 
                                have tested my abilities. I am a figure skater,
                                meaning I wake up and practice before my school day 
                                begins, five mornings a week. I have been an avid 
                                competitor in this sport for 8 years. Throughout my 
                                years as an athlete, I have learned how to hold myself 
                                accountable as I alone am responsible for how well I
                                perform, thus I have had to balance both a rigorous 
                                course schedule along with the demands of training many
                                hours both on and off the ice. Furthermore, this sport 
                                has instillled discipline within me, as I have had to 
                                sacrifice many experiences other peers my age get to 
                                enjoy in lieu of practices or competitions, along with
                                eating nutritious meals on a daily basis and ensuring I
                                remain focused during practices and conditioning.

                                Over the summer of 2018, I worked as a camp 
                                counselor at Dublin Iceland to provide children with
                                fairly little to no background experience skating 
                                the opportunity to learn the basics of this sport. I
                                needed to keep track of my own group of campers, 
                                supervising them during practice time, 
                                choreographing a routine for them to perform at the 
                                end of the week, and ensuring positive camper 
                                experience through group bonding activities. This 
                                experience has taught me to remain patient and calm
                                when working with others, for things would not 
                                always work out the way I wanted them to. I used the
                                first few days on the job to mirror other counselors
                                and understand how the camp dynamic worked, which I 
                                quickly picked up on. I was unafraid to ask my head 
                                supervisor questions and worked cooperatively with 
                                my fellow counselors, resolute when handling some of 
                                the more dreaded tasks. I have never been one to back 
                                down from challenging concepts/tasks and will 
                                always be a diligent team member. Thank you for 
                                taking the time to read through my About Me and 
                                considering me to be part of your workforce. I
