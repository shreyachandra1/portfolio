                            As part of our Entrepreneurship Project, my team was tasked with creating
                            a product and developing a business plan that we would present in front of
                            our class and compete with other teams to see who would move onto the next
                            round of the competition. Our product required detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/179SCfhiq0m-LZKFiAkwUvSlkfEVrk-Jfze-dzGlbKAI/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a> 
                            throughout, which we supplemented with a <a class="#" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eTOKeolBOJeBcWu-5_RbqJF_tSYeIfV/view?usp=sharing">video</a>
                            and <a class="#" href="https://forms.gle/aJh8YukQWVBCywbc9">survey</a>
                            to conduct research for our product evaluation. My group was particularly
                            interested in preventingpackage theft, and thus 3D modeled an improved 
                            version of the typical doormat which would set an alarm as soon as the package
                            was placed on the mat. If a porch pirate attempted to run off with the package,
                            the police would be notified immediately. Otherwise, the home owner could simply
                            return home, turn the alarm off, and collect their package. In order to ensure
                            security, our doormat has a barcode scanner that scans the barcode already on
                            the package's label to activate the alarm. Moreover, there is also a weight 
                            sensor and suction cups (which we included in our second iteration) to also 
                            activate the alarm and pull the package down to the mat to prevent the thief
                            from being able to steal the mat in the first place. My primary contributions
                            to this project were the 3D modeling of both doormat iterations, as well as 
                            documentation and slideshow presentation development.

                            For this particular project, my group and I were tasked 
                            with developing a mousetrap powered toy made from everyday
                            objects, with the toy's motion being able to last as long
                            as possible, as well as be an attractive and robust design.
                            Several constraits for this project included a maximum budget
                            of $5.00 (for purchased materials), and unlimited recyclable
                            materials. A pull back and release action was necessary to
                            operate the model, with a maximum time to re-set and re-release
                            being 2 minutes. The movement also needed to last for at least
                            8 seconds from release. Prohibited materials included hot glue,
                            tape, and fasteners, and prohibited tools included saws of any 
                            type and drills of any type. Out team decided to create a 
                            "Jurassic Carousel," which was powered by the mousetrap and
                            subsequent pulley system. The carriage was characterized as 
                            jurassic due to our inclusion of small, colorful toys dinosaur
                            toys on our miniature carousel, which we were able to purchase
                            with the less than $5.00 budget. My personal contributions to 
                            the project included constructing the carousel itself, as well
                            as the <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11tma1qWE9cNFaA8jHMYfIo7S5kogCD0Wy1tRBOnEP9M/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>

                            To conclude our Artificial Intelligence unit, my partner
                            and I were tasked with creating a chatbot using the concepts
                            we had learned in class, as well as potential other external
                            libraries, in order to develop a bot that can maintain a
                            conversation. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1FGy0BfhsgOhZ8W1v2aZqusRNDgP5cRI0mSM9Vpsb0/edit?usp=sharing">instructions</a> 
                            to develop this product requiring detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MTKPfcVhuIPdlbol3DF7eGjc-KvADTwhDt5aLVJ-37M/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>
                            describing how our chatbot worked and the thought process
                            that went into its creation. My partner and I decided upon a 
                            bot that could continuously improve upon itself, such as an 
                            assistance chatbot that is often used for customer service. 
                            Using the HashMap library, we created a simple bot that possessed
                            a few pre-programmed responses to key words or statements that it 
                            could detect in the user's responses, as well as included a 
                            conditional statement that allowed the user to explain to the
                            bot the type of response desired in the future if it encountered
                            a similar statement to the one that was currently not recognizeable.
                            Throughout this project, I primarily worked on developing potential
                            responses, detecting key words in a user's response, and "remembering"
                            the user's suggested response. This project also occured virtually, and
                            I learned how to share and collaborate on code in a virtual setting.

                            As part of our CS Research unit, my team was tasked with selecting
                            a CS-related concept we found to be intriguing and developing a project
                            that would showcase our chosen concept to our class. We were provided
                            with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GckfArNQ08b1qNfYn3ACVqLLmUaWj8CGePKGdl_L-UA/edit?usp=sharing">instructions</a>

                            we had decided to research. My group was particularly interested in data
                            analysis, so we chose to learn R and create a wine recommendation system
                            based upon values provided by UC Irvine. As part of this recommendation
                            system, we took a smaller sample of data from our larger data set in order
                            to allow the user to compare and contrast specific components of their 
                            chosen wines, displayed various data plots in order to showcase this data
                            as a visualization, and developed a k-NN model in order to truly recommend
                            a wine to our user. Throughout this project, I primarily worked on developing
                            cleaning CSV files, creating code to take a smaller sample size of data, and
                            showcasing our data in plots. This project also occured virtually, and
                            I learned how to quickly pick up a new language and create a project using
                            what I had learned.

                            enhance the player's understanding of a concept. We were

                            analyses of our individual contributions towards the 
                            project. My team chose to create a game that would be 
                            best used to aid in the learning of the AP Chemistry 
                            concept of electron affinity. Our game consisted of a 
                            cannon, which would eject photons at the Bohr model in
                            order to remove the outer ring's electrons. The object 
                            of the game was to remove the electrons at the correct
                            energy level, as we had a fluctuating energy bar. Throughout
                            this project, I primarily worked on developing the cannon and
                            energy bar. This project also occured virtually, and I 
                            learned how to successfully develop an elaborate coding
                            project in a short time period.

                            with a team of of two other students in order to develop
                            a smaller version of the seating chart, which my class
                            later pushed to GitHub and merged to create our final 
                            product. We were provided with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXHXPRPMxRrH3454e6J3I0AnPQPA_PEv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">instructions</a> 
                            to ensure we would each meet the required specifications
                            for the project. We each created our own "avatar" on 
                            Greenfoot, which consisted of our individual picture, a
                            small animation that would run once our image was clicked, 
                            and a soundbite where we introduced ourselves. This project
                            helped to enhance my basic understanding of Java (which
                            Greenfoot utilizes). As this project took place during 
                            the COVID-19 shelter in place order, my team and I had
                            to meet virtually through Zoom to create this project 
                            and merge our individual avatars together. We learned 
                            how to adapt to this new method of collaboration, and
                            found that we were able to cooperate and assist one 
                            another effectively even though we were unable to meet
                            in person.

                            For our Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project, my team and I 
                            constructed a vehicle using VEX parts that could be

                            as to how our prototype worked, screenshots of and 
                            annotations for our vehicle wired in series and parallel
                            for both fuel cell configurations, efficiency measurements
                            and calculations, and a power source evaluation. Our most 
                            efficient vehicle test run was powered by two solar fuel 
                            cells in a series circuit configuration, as it had the 
                            highest efficiency rate of 65.84%. Conversely, our least 
                            efficient test run proved to be the usage of one hydrogen
                            fuel cell in a parallel circuit configuration, only 
                            generating an efficiency rate of 9.77%. The main problem my 
                            team encountered was deducing how best to make our vehicle 
                            run using hydrogen fuel cells, as they would quickly run out
                            of power, which we resolved through repeated trial and error.
                            I was project manager once again, meaning I ensured my team 
                            was systematically accomplishing the necessary requirements. 
                            My main tasks in the assignment were constructing barriers
                            to secure the fuel cells to the vehicle, adjusting the chain 
                            and sprocket attached to the back wheels' axle to fit within
                            the measurements allocated by the project's constraints, and 
                            completing the image annotations on our documentation. This 
                            project scored well because it met the necessary criteria in

                            Throughout this project, I learned how to utilize series and 
                            parallel circuitry to create power in real life situations,
                            the pros and cons behind various alternative energy methods,
                            and how to effectively delegate responsibilities within a 
                            team such that all members contributed equal effort to the

                            For our Incredible Lifter Mechanical Winch Project,
                            in which a combination of VEX and Fisher Tech parts 
                            were used, my team and I designed and produced a 
                            prototype powered by a FisherTech motor that would
                            lift a 1.152N weight 30cm off of the ground. We also
                            had to produce a working NetLogo simulation of our 
                            prototype. We were provided with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwaVmBMxHhMOcGGnY-US1X6SfGKexFrX_PM61zVW2tA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">criteria</a> 
                            to develop this product requiring detailed <a class="#" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cKZn4RU-9M4Iwzy5YMTXhn5k-woH0kAICCnBXxfq4YA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> 
                            as to how our prototype worked, screenshots of our
                            NetLogo code, efficiency measurements and calculations,
                            and a functionality evaluation. Our final
                            product uses a power supply and switch to activate the 
                            motor, which powers a Fisher Tech gear. On the same axle
                            as the Fisher Tech gear is a VEX gear, powering a simple
                            gear train by connecting to a larger VEX gear, which shares
                            the same axle as the "spool" of thread used to lift the
                            weight. The main problem my team encountered was determining
                            how to successfully power the motor to turn our two gear 
                            trains, which we resolved through trial and error, spending
                            additional time after school for many days in order to 
                            verify that our system worked properly. I was project manager,
                            meaning I ensured my team was systematically accomplishing
                            the necessary requirements. My main tasks in the assignment 
                            were creating the NetLogo simulation, as well as working 
                            hands-on with my team to construct our prototype. This 
                            project scored well because it met the necessary criteria in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fg1RQ4gnMm-zOQ3Lqsf-KqkZ0wMx4YdQ-YZqKepUzW0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rubric</a>.
                            Throughout this project, I learned how to create user
                            modifiable GUIs using the NetLogo programming language,
                            how to hold a team accountable and keep them motivated, 
                            and gained familiarity with both Fisher Tech and VEX parts.

                            wanted to be able to apply their brand image as a frame,

                            as to how our work was evenly distributed. Our final
                            product allows the client to include a pre-designed
                            logo, drop shadow effect, and multiple borders. The
                            client may alter the logo's color, opacity, size, 
                            and location. The background color can be changed, 
                            or an image can be used as the background of 
                            another for the drop shadow effect. The various 
                            borders offered can also change in both color and 
                            thickness. We encountered a multitude of problems 
                            during the development phase of our project, primarily
                            in how we would allow the user to modify each mask to 
                            their desire, which my partner and I worked together
                            to resolve through continuous trials and modification.
                            My main tasks in the assignment were creating the logo,
                            horizontal stripes border, triangle corners border,
                            triangle sides border, and triangles and rectangles 
                            border, and I assisted my partner when needed in 
                            allowing the user to apply multiple masks at once.
                            This project received full credit because it met the
                            necessary criteria in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iW61y3ZrsSVRWcH1_VTykV3_JLrBGTiF1LAsQqh870w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rubric</a>
                            and offered more complexity than desired. Throughout
                            this project, I learned how to apply a mulitude of 
                            features to images using Python, how to create higher
                            level code that includes efficient algorithms and 
                            abstractions, and how to compromise and work effectively
                            with a partner when issues arose in our code.

                            causing us to rebuild the framework of the app. The 
                            newly created app now has a bar with prestored colors
                            and a canvas that draws lines in all directions. The
                            size of the paintbrush was made to be adjustable and 
                            we included two different eraser settings, one which
                            erased the entire canvas and another where only small
                            sections of the canvas would be erased by dragging a 
                            finger. A separate button was added to provide

                            specific sections of the drawing and creating a
