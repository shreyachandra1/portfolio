                            During my time in the Engineering Academy program, I have met a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers, through whom I've gained valuable insight
                            about the STEM workfield. One field trip I went on during my sophomore year of high school was to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in which I visited the National Ignition Facility
                            (NIF). At NIF, I was first introduced to the primary fuel sources the facility is experimenting with, including deuterium and tritium (hydrogen isotopes) fuel, by one NIF scientist. Accompanied
                            by another NIF computer scientist, I toured the facility and was able to view its lasers and nuclear reactors up close. Throughout this tour, I learned about how a weak laser pulse is split
                            multiple times during a reaction to pass through numerous laser amplifier beamlines, and then travels through an optics assembly before being focused onto the laser beam's target, a journey 
                            that takes about only 5 microseconds. This experience was both useful and memorable to me because I was able to view how computer science could be used in a research setting for scientific 
                            topics beyond simply software, as well as being able to connect what I had recently learned about nuclear science in my Honors Chemistry class to this real life laboratory. Also, as I had been
                            paired with a tour guide who had majored in computer science, she was able to answer all of my questions about the computer/software used by researchers at NIF, which added greatly to my 
                            overall field trip experience.

                            One influential guest speaker was Jason Yosinski, who works at UBER AI Labs, and provided my Honors Principles of Engineering class with an in-depth explanation to artifical intelligence in
                            contrast to machine learning, along with showing us several projects he had worked on. From his presentation, I learned that machine learning is a more specific version of AI, as it will 
                            continuously improve/gain knowledge, while AI itself is a broad description of items/programs with artificial intelligence that may or may not improve. I also learned about language moduling 
                            with Google and OpenAI, which is a software companies are testing to improve the interaction of humans with their virtual assistants (such as Google Assisstant or Amazon's Alexa), and about 
                            neural networks, which are made up of layers, with each layer having a vector as both an input and output. Mr. Yosinksi further detailed how, to make a whole neural network, multiple layers 
                            are stacked on top of one another. His career was inspiring to me because I was able to see the potential of what AI could develop into in the future, and has made me want to undertake some
                            AI-based projects.
